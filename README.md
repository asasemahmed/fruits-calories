# Calorie Calculator for Fruits using YOLOv8 Algorithm

Welcome to the Calorie Calculator for Fruits repository! üçèüçåüçì

## Overview:

This Python project combines the power of the YOLOv8 algorithm with Tkinter to create an interactive and user-friendly application for calculating the sum of calories in various fruits. Whether you're health-conscious or just curious about your daily nutrition, this tool provides a seamless way to monitor your fruit intake.

## Key Features:

- **YOLOv8 Integration:** Utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 algorithm for accurate and efficient object detection in images of fruits.

- **Tkinter GUI:** An intuitive graphical user interface built with Tkinter, making the calorie calculation process accessible to users of all experience levels.

- **Dynamic Calculation:** Real-time updates as you add or remove fruits, allowing you to track your daily fruit consumption dynamically.

- **Extensive Fruit Database:** A comprehensive database of fruits with corresponding calorie information, ensuring precise calculations.

## How to Use:
